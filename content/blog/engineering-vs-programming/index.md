> Hey Miggy, isn't software engineering just programming? Why should we make a distinction between the two?

Well why do we have to distinguish the differences between a square and a rectangle? So that we know the difference. For the sole purpose of knowing more than we did when we woke up this morning. Here are a few things that I have learned about Software Engineering vs. Programming in the 3 months I've been here at Microsoft.

## Build vs. Play

You may read this thinking that I am bashing on programmers who aren't engineers, but I want to make it clear that I don't think that one is better than the other. It would be like comparing apples to oranges. They provide different vitamins to you, but at the end of the day they are good for your health.

Let's start off with the responsibilities because that seems to be where they differ the most.

With programmers the main audience is themselves and maybe their peers.

> Hey Miggy, can you build me an app that tells me when my printer is broken?

Sure, Mom! Any programmer can do this given some time learning a language and sometime messing around with a printer. The only one who really benefits from this is my mom and I know my mom will always love me even if the code sucks. As long as it works, right?

As a programmer, I don't really care about code quality. I want to play with the coolest, most bleeding-edge technology that's super unstable because I like problem solving and I like breaking things and making them work at the end. It's also kind of fun showing it off to my friends because now they think I'm some kind of wizard. You should have seen my girlfriend's face when I put up a Minecraft server on Google Cloud Platform for her Valentine's present.

Programming is fun. Being a programmer is fun. Where else do you have such a (relatively) low barrier of entry to play with all these cool toys. What happens when you play with new toys in Chemistry? You could die. Do you want to die? No? Then switch to CS (plug).

> Miggy that's kinda dark... But I get it. So are you saying Software Engineering isn't fun?

Software Engineering is a **different** type of fun. It's fun with pressure. Some people like building really BIG things. Software Engineers build solutions while programmers build applications.

> What...

## Solutions vs Applications

An application solves a single problem that someone is having. In my case, my mom wants to know when her printer is broken. As long as it works and she can use it easily, it's all good. Is this something you need a team of 50 people working on? Probably not. Will Microsoft pay millions of dollars for this app? Probably not. If it breaks, just go back and fix it. You wrote the code, you should know how to fix it/debug it.

> So an application doesn't require a lot of maintenance? So let me guess, a solution does?

Look at you smarty-pants. A solution is a really really good application that is both maintainable and scalable. Let's say you were tasked with creating software that needs to manage all of the health records of all the patients in a hospital.

You have to make sure that all the data is consistent meaning that you always get back the right information when you search for something, that the solution is fast enough to search through and store millions if not billions of documents, and that it doesn't break when a document is malformated.

Not only do you have to think about that, but you also have to keep your code quality in check. This is a huge project with people's lives on the line. More than likely there are going to be multiple people working on this at once. Code is a language in every sense of the word and everyone has their own way of writing it. If something breaks, a developer should make out where the bug came from, even if they didn't write the code by reading the documentation/comments that you wrote in code.

As a software engineer, not only do you cater to the needs of your customers, but also to the needs of your fellow developers and other people on your team.

There are a lot of overlaps, but there are very distinct differences between being an engineer and being a programmer. Again, being a programmer and not an engineer is completely fine. Being both is also possible. I consider myself both an engineer and a programmer. I love playing with new libraries and seeing how they work and seeing how they interact with other technologies, but I also like building really big and impressive systems that impact millions of people.

> So how do I know whether or not I want to become and engineer or if I want to be programmer or both?

You don't.

Do whatever makes your happy. If it means playing with cool software or using code to help speed up your daily workflow, do just that. If you like the thrill of being under pressure at all times and building solutions, then do that. Code is first a language, then an art. Let's treat it as such.

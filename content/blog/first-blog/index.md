## Let's talk about Gatsby
So I took some time tonight to start on a blog. I was looking at [Dan Abramov's](https://overreacted.io/) personal
blog and I wanted to make something quick and easy to make. Here we are 3 hours later with a blog that actually works
and is on Google App Engine.

Really excited to start this up and I hope that this becomes a regular thing! I am hoping to talk about my girlfriend
on this blog though. I would like to go on cool adventures and tell yall about it and keep track of all the cool stuff
that we/I/she starts doing

Formal intro to who I am is coming soon!

Thank you guys for reading!

```go
// BeHappy is the meaning of life. Thank you for coming to my TED talk
func BeHappy() {
  passion := "Something you really like to do"
  for {
    go Do(passion)
  }
}
```

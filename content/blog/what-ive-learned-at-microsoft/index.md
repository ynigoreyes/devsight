description: "How it's like as an intern at Microsoft"

> Hey man, so what projects are you working on at Microsoft? Is is cool?

**Well let me start with bringing up the fact that I am under NDA and can't disclose a lot of information...**

> Well, how's it like to be there? Like honestly. Is it fun? Is it a lot of code? What does your day usually consist of?

I think it would be appropriate to explain how far along I am in terms of this internship.
I started on Monday, May 13th as an Explore Intern and honestly, it's the dream.

Waking up and knowing you are going to work on a really cool project that is going
to affect millions of people if not billions is one hell of an experience.

> What do you like about it so much?

I like how it's nothing as I would have expected. I feel like people who know they are
doing tell others that everything has to be [Agile](https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/)
and that everything must be organized and everything needs to be done a certain
way or else it's wrong.

That's not how it is at Microsoft or at least for me and my team.

I like to see it as organized chaos. You get to come in whenever you want as long
as you get all of your work done. We have FTE (Full Time Engineers) coming in
as early as 7am and then some come in during the middle of stand-up, which is at
10:30am with coffee and and a cup of water in their hands.

You have a lot of independence. There is a lot of trust and there is not a lot of
micro-managing. I also maybe just lucky with my manager, but whatever. They show
you how to get started and help you get through the problems that come up while
you are developing and it's awesome.

> Okay that sounds cool and all, but I want to here about everything else in DEPTH. I want to know what happens in the morning after you poop, up until you go to bed.

#### In the morning

I usually get up around 8am so I can get to work around 9am. If I **know** that
there is a lot to do that day, I'll come in around 8:30. Everyone comes in between 7
and 10am. During that time I try and remember what I did the day before, look
at what I have to do for the day, check on emails and all the boring stuff.

> Okay... Then?????

We will usually have stand up around 10:30am and that's when we all talk about
what we have done in the last 24 hours and what we are going to do today.

Stand up usually lasts about 15-20 minutes and then we go back to doing whatever
we we're doing. I usually ask 1 or 2 important questions regarding my part of the
project. I try to keep in mind, everyone has things to do today and they need to
get back to work.

So here is where it's really up in the air.

#### How everything is a little different from school

In school, it's work, work, work and more work. Software Engineering, especially
at Microsoft is a lot of planning and incremental progress. As a dev(eloper), you
will be meeting with a lot PM(Project Manager)s about how your project is going
and what needs to get done.

This is where I learned about the **value of an engineer's time**. They want you
working on something that is not only worth **your** while, but **their's** as well.
They pay us big bucks to get this project done and there are a lot of people
depending on this product.

You have to work smart and hard. The good news is that you will never be the
smartest person in the room. If you think you are, I don't feel bad at all
for telling you that **you're wrong**. There are people out here to help you
and are trying to reach the same goal.

> Well what if I don't know everything that I need to for the project?

The Principle Engineer next to you probably doesn't know every single detail either
so don't feel bad.

Here is what separates the coders from the engineers.

- Can you handle criticism?
- Can you accept that you are wrong?
- How quickly can you learn what you need to know?

On my team, we are using something called Service Fabric, which is a distributed
systems platform that allows for developers to create services independently from
each other that will work together in the end to make up a complete application.

I had no idea how to use it or how any of it worked, but I needed to know
at least the basics so that I can have a decent conversation with another
dev about it.

I took about an hour or two to read through the docs and how it was used in
the application. Throughout the day, I would read code and docs
about the topic and ask questions when I see that there seems to be a whole
in my knowledge.

Make sure to be patient as people are also busy. Ask them the questions
and wait for them to make time to answer your question.

> So it really isn't possible to just know everything that needs to be known for the project?

Typically, no. You need to train your brain to be a sponge and just absorb
everything that is taught you. My girlfriend can tell you that I have the **worst**
memory. Since, I can't remember anything, I usually just write what I need to know
down and then read about it later on my own time and talk to myself.

#### In the afternoon

After working on code for an hour or two and going to a meeting with another
dev or PM, I go to lunch with some friends. Again, they really don't micro-manage
you at all. Sometimes lunch is 1 hour, sometimes it's 3 if we are going out to get
boba.

After lunch, I try to talk to my team about what they are working on to see if
we are all on the same page. Right now, the two interns that I work with are working
on a different, but connected part of the project and sometimes, something comes
up that changes our game plan.

Again, incremental learning is important.

> So far you have talked about coding for about 1-2 hours... Is that correct?

Well, yeah. A lot of my day is spent planning and thinking about diagrams.
Coding (if you know the language) is honestly the easy part once you actually
know what you are building. The hard part is trying to figure out how your code
needs to fit into everyone else's.

> Is there anything you don't like about working at Microsoft and/or in industry?

The only complaint I have is not having enough hours in the work day to get what
I want to get done. Honestly for me, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect team.
Your mileage may vary. It really just depends on the team.

If there was one thing to really be nit-picky about is that headass-ery
(being really cocky and annoying) is still quite prevalent. There are still
people who mans-plain and go off on their own topics, but I really didn't
expect for it to go away, and I am at fault, too.

Team, if you are reading this, don't worry. This does not pertain to you.
You guys are great.

Just make sure that you know when you are in the wrong and move on. It will
make your life a lot easier.

> So is the project actually hard?

Mine? Yes. There are a lot of moving parts and there is a lot of code that is written
out and you just have to assume that it works and that it has been tested.

**But that's the fun part**.

It's been a while since I have had to learn a lot very quickly, and it really is
satisfying when you **finally get it** and are able to hear **"Yes! Exactly!**

#### Around 5pm

This is about the time where I start to wrap up what I am doing. I try to come up
with a good stopping point where I can send in my code (PR) for review. After getting,
to that stopping point... That's it really. I call my girlfriend and find an Uber
and do whatever really. I usually spend my nights playing PUBG with my girlfriend
and watching YouTube.

> This blog has kind of been all over the place...

Yeah... But really that's just how software engineering is. There is beauty
in learning the unknown. You can learn so much from just listening to the people
around you.

I'm sorry if this is not the blog that you were looking for, but this is me and
what I have experienced/learned in the first few months at a Big N tech company.
If there is anything you get from reading it, let it be this...

**Listen.**

Listen to people and what they have to say before you begin to speak. There is
so much you can learn from just closing your mouth and take in everything
around you. There are smart people all around you. Get comfortable with being
around those people.

People will appreciate you so much more if you sit back and listen to what
they have to say, especially in tech.

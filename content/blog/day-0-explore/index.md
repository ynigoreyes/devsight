> Hey Miggy, what's been going on in terms of Microsoft? And spell it out for the people in the back!

So this past year, I have been given the opportunity to interview for Microsoft for the Explore Program.
TL;DR, the Explore Program is Microsoft's internship offering for Freshman and Sophomore students.
It gives us the chance to try out Microsoft without having to go up against the upperclassman geniuses
when interviewing.

I got an email back in August 2018 that I had a phone screen with an engineer at Microsoft. I was very
excited especially since Google's interview didn't go to well. I saw this as a redemption. And so I told
myself this is going to be the internship that I am going to crush and work really hard on to get.

> What did you do to prep? I heard they have very technical interviews.

I listened to what successful people said about the interview process and tried to notice where I lacked
in terms of skill in data structures and algorithms. I knew that Graphs and Dynamic Programming were
some topics I didn't have down just yet.

#### LeetCode - in General
I found that there are two ways to use LeetCode. The first one being for those who are still learning
data structures and algorithms. The second is choosing a question to solve based on difficulty.
If you have a Big N interview coming up, LeetCode Medium problems need to be solved within 45 minutes.

Make sure to **use a timer** when practicing. I usually like to have my timers count up so that I
can see how much time has passed. I see it as me **spending** time instead of **wasting** time
as I would feel if it were a count down timer.

I tried to solve at least 1 or 2 questions every weekday.
I was dedicated, but I also wanted to enjoy college and be with my girlfriend (Shout out to Shinn!).

#### LeetCode - Data Structures

I would suggest picking a question based on the data structure, disregarding
the difficulty and try solve it. The thing that I looked for were patterns between problems.
What did I find myself doing all the time when faced with these problems?

Take caution with this approach as it is **not a good representation of your interviewing skills**.
During the interview, especially for these large companies, the data structure in question is
usually not obvious. Finding the data structure is half the battle. This

Cracking the Coding is also a very good option. This also help

#### LeetCode - Algorithms

This is the **true test of technical capability during an interview**. Pick a problem based on difficulty
and the passing rate. Time yourself for 45 minutes, and treat it as a personal mock interview.
Take 10 minutes or less to figure out optimal solution. If there is no optimal solution, start writing
the brute force solution. After 45 minutes are done, look back at your work and see where you went wrong
and what went well.

After those 45 minutes are over and if you did not finish the problem, spend another 30 minutes trying
to solve it and if you cannot solve it within that time, look at the solution that is given. **Yes**,
look at the solution. Trying to solve a interview problem really sucks when you have going at it for 3 hours.
Rest, and try another problem.

#### Mock Interviews

This will **test if you can properly communicate your ideas**. Find a friend who is better than you
in this type of stuff and ask (politely) if they have the time to give you a 1 hour mock interview.
**DO NOT** ask them to give you a specific question about a certain data structure. That ruins the
purpose of the mock interview. Asking them questions about a certain data structure is usually
okay.

The goal for this mock interview is to...
1. Demonstrate technical prowess
2. Show the interview that you can explain in a way that is simple and easy to follow

Your real interviewer will most likely be an engineer as well so you can use technical terms when
needed. What I have found is that your goal should be to make the interviewer feel as smart as possible.
You want them to be on the exact same page as you are. Once they get lost in your code, you already
lost points.

I usually did these 1-2 times a week.

#### Reading Cracking the PM Interview

This really **helps with behavioral questions.** The book went over how one should answer common
behavioral questions and how someone should structure their "Tell me about yourself" pitch.

What I did was that I was able to recite my intro on a pin drop and I suggest you do the same.
Every single interviewer will ask you "So tell me a little bit about yourself?" and you need
to be able to answer **without any hesitation** and **with direct eye contact** about who you
are as a person.

Read the book for more detail, but in short...

1. Keep it professional sounding.
2. Allow for the interviewer to interact with you.
> "Would you like to know more about my officer positions or what I did during my personal projects?"
3. Be happy and make the interviewer comfortable talking with you.
4. Ask questions at the end. If you don't it shows that you are uninterested and don't care for the job.

Honestly, the interview process is a game and you need to learn how to play your cards right. Show off,
but don't come off as a jerk that puts other people down. No one is going to want to work with you
if you are rude and overly confident. Just because you sound smart and have all these cool tools
under your belt does not mean you are a shoe-in for the job.

**These companies don't need computers, they need engineers. Act the part**

> This sounds pretty intense... Well how did you do on the phone screen?

## The Phone Screen

The phone screen was interesting. I feel like posting exact questions on this blog would be unethical (and pointless),
but I can say that from my experience it was relatively easy in comparison to typical technical questions.
The hard part of the interview came with the design question.

**Design questions are asked to see how you would respond to a certain senario or
how you would build out a product.**

> So you got in!

**I didn't get in.** They told me that I did very well, but they had run out of space in the program.
That didn't sit very well with me. I put in a lot of work and to hear that I would have gotten in if
they had enough space really sucks.

I did recieve an email saying there was an open spot, probably because someone backed out
of the onsite interviews. I was happy, but **I was not** satisfied for being considered
a back up plan.

## The Onsite Interviews

> That's really weird, but at least you got it, right? How did your onsites go? Were they hard?
Did you do anything differently to prepare for them?

I was really upset for a moment, so I decided that my goal for this interview was to do so well,
that I would become an obvious choice for the job.

I started doing 1-2 LeetCode medium problems a day. For all of my mock interviews, I was given
graph problems. Graph problems are nice since they are real-world applications of data structures
and algorithms. They usually also implement multiple data structures and algorithms at the same time.

3 days before my actual interview, I stopped prepping. I hung out with my girlfriend, made sure
to wipe my butt in the morning, literally anything, but data structures and algorithms. I wanted
to make sure that I was as calm as possible flying to Seattle.

#### And the interviews themselves come marching in

It's 8am and I am on the Microsoft campus, waiting to be called. We had 3-4 interviews back to back, all 45 minutes each.
It was brutal, but also very fun. I got to meet really cool full time engineers and was able to ask
them what they were working on.

The interviews were hard. Very technical. Sometimes the interviewer would talk to me for 10-15 minutes about
what I did as a student and what I'm interested in and some interviewers just wanted to ask and/or know my name.

Again, I cannot tell you what exactly was on the interview, but I can say once again that LeetCode Medium
problems should be sufficient practice.

I made sure to remember everything I practiced. Eye contact, smiling, hand gestures when explaining
myself to the interviewer. I imagined it as another mock interview. Just another day doing algorithms.
I made sure to calm down enough and remember that this is what I loved doing. Problem solving and coding.

#### And just like that... All 3 interviews were finished

> You had to "practice" smiling and keeping eye contact and using your hands?

Like I said, it's a game. In this game, attention to detail is key. You meet all the requirements,
but can you communicate that you know what you are doing in the correct way to where they think
you are the best candidate for the job?

#### Attention to detail is key

> So what happened after the onsites? How long did you have to wait until you got your results back?

## After the Onsites

I went back to Texas Tech after a pretty long night with some friends that I made during the
interview process and I sat there waiting for my results. I tried to keep calm and wait patiently,
but my mind was just running with things I could have done wrong.

"What if I didn't keep track of my recursive calls correctly?"

"What if I said something stupid during the behavioral part and not know it?"

I couldn't sit still. All I could do was think... Is all my hard work going to pay off?
All of those hours of practice for what?

They told me that I wouldn't get results back for another 2-3 weeks. Honestly, that was really hard
to hear. I had to sit in the dark for 2-3 weeks just hoping that I got in.

**Three days later** I was in mid conversation with a friend of mine and I got a call. We both looked
at it and stopped talking. We both knew why someone from Washington would be calling.

I had to step outside and throughout my entire phone call, my heart was racing and I
couldn't keep still. Even now, I had so much emotion running throughout my body. I couldn't keep my hands still.

And then I heard the words I have been waiting for.

"We are happy to inform you that we have chosen you for a position at Microsoft as an Explore Intern this upcoming Summer."

The recruiter probably thought I was really weird because of how excited and happy I was on the phone.
It was a great day and I immediately told all my friends.

## A few words to the students...

I was told that Texas Tech was not a Computer Science school. My father even told me to transfer to UTD
since it was a better school. I tried transfering to UT Austin because I thought my chances of
getting noticed by a big company would be better.

Here is the thing about Computer Science and Software Engineering. You can choose to let it
be your major, or you can take the time and make it your passion. Just because you don't go
to Stanford, doesn't mean you can't get into a trillion dollar company (congrats Microsoft!).

You have to work very hard, and you will get s*** on by a lot of people. They're going to say that
you suck and that you aren't good enough to get in. There are many people out there who just
want to put you down because it makes them feel better inside knowing that they are better than you.

Those are the people you don't want to be around. Thank you Texas Tech for giving me a community
of nerds who are passionate about Software Engineering and Computer Science just like I am.

Surround yourself with good people. Good people will get you to good places.

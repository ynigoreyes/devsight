I came up this topic in a Facebook post that stated that there were some people out there who
said that you shouldn't learn Django/Flask unless you are specifically using it for Machine Learning
of AI.

First off, what do **you** think. If you don't know Django is a web application framework for Python and Flask
is a micro framework for Python. TL;DR they both make it easier for the developer to make web apps.

> I'm not sure, man. What questions do I even ask myself to figure out if I would use it?

Honestly this blog could be summed up in a few words so might as well

> Use the right tool, for the right job.

I'm going to go over the questions that I ask myself when I see a new shiny toy

![Question 1](./1.gif)
## What are you looking to do?
Based on what I just said, it only seems fair to start off with this question. Let's start off with **YOU**.
Click on the description to jump, but I still think you can learn something if you read along
1. [I am a freshman at University and I want to make my resume look awesome by learning more languages.](#for-our-freshman)
2. [I am a junior at University and I want to get into Web Development so that I look good for other companies.](#for-our-junior-developers)
3. [I am a software engineer and I am looking to get into my dream company right now.](#for-the-ambitious-ones)

#### For our Freshman
I would say **yes**. Just learn it honestly. If you heard that it is popular right now,
then learn it. Even if you end up **HATING** it.

It will be a learning experience. I remember I tried learning Angular
which is a framework that lets me build websites quicker. It was a lot easier than raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but I did
not like using the command line just to make stuff. It was also very big. There was so much to Angular and I did
**NOT** want to spend the time to learn everything about it.

What I did learn is how much I liked React, another
library (arguably a framework now) for building responsive web pages. Today, I build everything in React because of
how much I hated working in Angular.

If you have the time, learn it. You will have time to touch a bunch of different technologies. Spend some time and
play with the code and see what you do like and what you don't like. That way, you have a better idea on what your
next technology to learn should be

#### For our Junior Developers
Ask yourself. Is this **really** what you want to do? I feel like as a Junior, taking the time to learn something useless
to either yourself or a company takes a toll. You are trying to get a job and here you are playing with Haskel.

Let's say that you are a backend developer. You like the logic side of things. You don't like CSS and making things
centered on the web page. Should you learn Django/Flask? I would say that you should if you plan on being a backend
developer.

The more tools you have to your disposal, the better you will be at building proper solutions. Knowing these different
frameworks will help you see the faults and strengths of each of them. Then, you can make better decisions in the future
about what technology you want to learn because you would have a better understanding of the problems that arise
when dealing with a certain technology

I know that Python has some very large Docker Images. If I know that we will be doing the whole micro-services (ooOOooOOOOooo Ahhhhh)
thing, then maybe I would learn Golang so that I can be more efficient in this environmnet.

#### For the Ambitious Ones
I think it depends on what company you are applying for. Check out the job description. I know Google uses Golang
internally and it is the language that they built. So in that case, if I wanted to get into Google, I would really
consider learning a little bit more about that language.

Main point: Look into what the companies are looking for. Cater to their wants.

**However**, keep in mind that finding the perfect company is a two-way street. The company is trying
to find a match and so are you. Don't apply for a hardware company if you cannot stand the sight of a
circuit board.

If you see a company that you really like, is only hiring cyber security specialists, but you find that boring,
then don't apply/take the time to learn that technologies that they are using. You wont enjoy the job, so you
won't be as enthusiastic and waste both your time and the companies time.

This a generalization and should not be taken as without consideration of one's own decisions and knowledge of
the subject


#### At the end of the day
It really all depends. There are so many questions to ask. The more of then that you can answer, the better
engineer you will be.

## How much support is in this technology? Is it stable or is it kind of buggy?

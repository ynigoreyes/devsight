> So tell me about yourself.

So my name is Ynigo Reyes, but people usually refer to my as "Miggy" which is my nickname. Most of my time is spent talking to
my wonderful girlfriend [Shinn Bermudo](https://twitter.com/ShinnBermudo), making fun of my best friend Anthony Veserra and [Hector Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/Hector27036812),
and trying to come up with something to cook tonight.

I am currently a sophomore at Texas Tech University as a Dual Major in Computer Science and Mathematics. People always
ask my why I wanted to become a double major and I tell them "because it made sense". High-key not a fan of
calculus, but I **love** the theoretical proofs and the whole process of building solutions from the ground up.

> That's great and all, but I want to know about the technical stuff that you do

#### Association for Computing Machinery
Sounds good! At Texas Tech I am the Vice President and Software Development Lead for the Association for Computing Machinery.
My role consists of setting up workshops, talking to students, and holding software development classes every week.
Right now, I teach Applied Algorithms which is TL;DR a class where I teach students how to use the data structures and
algorithms that they learn in class so that they can do better during interviews and learn how to think like a computer scientist

#### Google Student Innovator
Along with officer positions in ACM, I am the Google Student Innovator for Texas Tech. The job descriptions goes something along the lines
of making sure that everyone and their mom knows about Google Cloud Platform and how to use it. I try and help out small groups in their
projects by giving them tips on how GCP can help their development cycle. I also give workshops and announce cool things
coming up with Google Cloud.

#### On my own time
I spend a lot of time on GitHub trying the newest and latest open source technologies. The one that I am most
interested in right now is [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). My favorite language right now
is [Golang](https://golang.org/) since it is pretty easy to write, looks pretty, a lot easier than C++ and pretty speedy.
I study/read a lot about cloud infrastructure and developing web applications for everyone to use. The goal in life
is to make life easier for you so that you can spend less time doing the stuff they **don't** want and more time doing the stuff
they **do** want.

> Do you have professional experience or do you just like to talk like you're the s***?

For the most part, yeah. I have a little bit of professional experience. I create web apps a lot and I worked for
a small local start up, but that didn't go so well. No names, but I was just not feeling like I was growing in that
company. I didn't like the culture a whole lot, and I really just applied because my friend works they and they said
they needed help.

However, I am an incoming Microsoft Explore Intern in Redmond, Seattle. I got my offer sometime in early February.
I'm really excited to learn about Azure and all the cool stuff that goes around in Microsoft.

**ProTip**: Make as many friends as you can when you fly out for interviews, because at the end of the day,
you still want to have fun and hangout with friends.

Right now (March 22), I am also in the process of interview with Google for a Software Development Internship in Fall 2019,
I am really excited for that because this would be my second go at this. I did not do well at all my first time
so this is kind of a redemption opportunity.

> So what's the plan? What do you want to do? What do you want to accomplish?

Well, obviously I want to finish school. I'd be the first person in my family to graduate from an American University
so yeah... College is a big deal in my family. I really want to work on cloud and making it more available and better
more easily accessible for anyone. Whether you are a sophomore in highschool that wants to get started with cloud or
a Senior Engineer at Uber that wants to be able to spin up entire infrastructure to accommodate their millions of users,
I want to help cloud be faster and easier for you to use.

I also want to have a kid. That would be cool.

Thank you for reading all the way through! That's me!
